# Java Socket API Example App: Whois Client

This small example application demonstrates the use of the App Engine Socket API to query a Whois server.

To access the Socket API from the dev appserver, you must enable the socket API using the " -Dsocket.permit_connect=true" VM command line argument.  This argument has been added to the 'runserver' option in the build.xml file.
